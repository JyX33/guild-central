## Decision

* Using Supabase with Postgres extensions (pg_cron, pgmq) and Edge Functions for the backend.

## Rationale

* Leverages Supabase's integrated platform, fits within free-tier constraints initially, allows for database-centric scheduling and queuing combined with serverless functions for API interactions, as outlined in `documentation/overview.md`.

## Implementation Details

* Details to be documented as features are implemented.
